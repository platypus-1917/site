A lecture by educator and social activist BILL AYERS


Monday, February 9

6:00 p.m.

SAIC Auditorium

280 South Columbus Drive

What's happening to intellectual space and what does the moment offer us as a way to resist? What's damaging the academy (including our own dogma) and how can we push back?

To all those in Chicago:

Join platypus at the Bill Ayers lecture; everyone is welcome to join or bring a friend. We will be meeting in front of the Columbus building at 5:30 so we can make sure to get seats. If anyone has any further questions, feel free to give me call or drop me an email. Hope to see you all there.
