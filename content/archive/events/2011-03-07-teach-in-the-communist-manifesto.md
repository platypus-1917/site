## Description

In the mid-19th century,Marx and Engels famously observed in the Communist Manifesto that a 'specter' was haunting Europe -- the specter of Communism. One hundred sixty years later, it is 'Marxism' itself that haunts us.

In the 21st century, it seems that the Left abandoned Marxism as a path to freedom. But Marx critically intervened in his own moment and emboldened Leftists to challenge society; is the Left not tasked with this today? Has the Left resolved the problems posed by Marx, and thus moved on? Does Marxism even matter?

Come discuss your thoughts with Platypus at the Communist Manifesto Teach-in, featuring a presentation by Laura Schmidt. Hosted by the Temple chapter of the Platypus Affiliated Society.
