title: Are We Liberated Yet?

{{% figure src="/img/Are%20We%20Liberated%20Yet-Poster.pdf" caption="The struggles for sexual liberation and women's rights of the past century leave us with an ambiguous legacy." %}}

How do the failures and successes of these movements inform the present? Recent events such as the passing of Proposition 8 in California and the ongoing repression of women in the Middle East make us wonder, are we more sexually liberated today than 20 or 50 years ago? What does the term "sexual liberation" even mean today? This panel discussion seeks to raise these questions and other new possible considerations for the discourse on sexuality within the Left.

The event will take the form of a moderated panel discussion, followed by an audience Q & A.
