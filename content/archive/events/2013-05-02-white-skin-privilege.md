### Platypus presents:

**"White-Skin Privilege"?**

Join Platypus in a discussion of the possible significance of the black question for the reconstitution of an American Left. As a prelude to a wider [panel discussion](http://chicago.platypus1917.org/black-politics-in-the-age-of-obama/), Mel Rothenberg will address the theoretical underpinnings of the white-skin privilege thesis originally formulated in the 1970s by the Chicago-based Sojourner Truth Organization, of which Rothenberg was a member.

Mel Rothenberg is the author of *The Myth of Capitalism Reborn: A Marxist Critique of Theories of Capitalist Restoration in the USSR*.
