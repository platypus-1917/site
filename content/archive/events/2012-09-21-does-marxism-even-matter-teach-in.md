*A teach-in on the Communist Manifesto*

Hosted by the Platypus Affiliated Society at Dalhousie

Part of the NSPIRG Alt-101 Radical Frosh Series

**Room 302, Student Union Building, Dalhousie University**

In the mid-19th century, Marx and Engels famously observed in the Communist Manifesto that a 'specter' was haunting Europe -- the specter of Communism. 160 years later, it is 'Marxism' itself that continues to haunt Left.

What does it mean that Marx and Marxism still appeal while political movements for socialism are weak or non-existent? What were Marxism's original points of departure for considering radical possibilities for freedom that still speak to the present? How does Marxism still matter?
