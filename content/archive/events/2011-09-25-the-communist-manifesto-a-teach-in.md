In the mid-19th century, Marx and Engels famously observed in the Communist Manifesto that a 'specter' was haunting Europe -- the specter of Communism. 160 years later, it is 'Marxism' itself that haunts us.In the 21st century, it seems that the Left abandoned Marxism as a path to freedom. But Marx critically intervened in his own moment and emboldened leftists to challenge society; is the Left not tasked with this today? Has the Left resolved the problems posed by Marx, and thus moved on? Does Marxism even matter? Hosted by the Platypus Affiliated Society.
