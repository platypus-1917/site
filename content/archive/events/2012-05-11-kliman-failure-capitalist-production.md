Platypus is a new international journal of critical letters and emancipatory politics, dedicated to the reconstitution of the Marxian Left (forthcoming).

The Platypus Affiliated Society, established in December 2006, organizes reading groups, public fora, research and journalism focused on problems and tasks inherited from the "Old" (1920s-30s), "New" (1960s-70s) and post-political (1980s-90s) Left for the possibilities of emancipatory politics today.
