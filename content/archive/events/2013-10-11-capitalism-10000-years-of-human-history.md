## Conference Room, Reynolds Club, University of Chicago

Join us for a teach-in on the history of capitalism, its problematics and possibilities, from the perspective of the present. Our speaker will lecture for about half an hour; this lecture will be followed by questions and discussion for another half hour.

The project advanced by the Platypus Affiliated Society, and the problems with which it tasks itself, will also be introduced.

All are welcome -- more importantly, all questions are encouraged.
