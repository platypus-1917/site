This talk will examine the historical and present-day strategies and challenges of antifascist struggles in Germany. Against the background of Marxist theory and "Autonomen"-style politics, join us to interrogate the failures of radical left politics and what ask what lessons we might draw from them and how they can inform challenges coming from the right in both Europe and the US today.

Our guest speakers are members of the Berlin-based anticapitalist organization TOP B3Rlin and the German-wide "UmsGanze" alliance of (post-)antifascist groups.
