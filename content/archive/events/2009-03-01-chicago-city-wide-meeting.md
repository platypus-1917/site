We want everyone from SAIC, UChicago, Loyola, DePaul and other Chicago platypi to a city-wide meeting and a night on the town.

It's about time everyone from around the city meets face to face to talk about the future of our group.

Come to discuss and plan our upcoming events in March and April√Ç along with our first international convention in June.

I hope to see you all there!
