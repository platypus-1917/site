> Capital is completely unprecedented in the history of humanity, hence, any struggle for emancipation beyond capital is also completely unprecedented.

--Chris Cutrone, "Capital in history: the need for a Marxian philosophy of history of the Left"


Please join us for a teach in on "Capital and History" this Wednesday at 2 pm in Humanities 2052. We will focus on the emergence of capital in history and the possibilities for transitioning beyond it. The teach-in will be delivered by a fellow Platypus member from NYC, Chris Mansour. We encourage anyone interested even remotely in Platypus or the Left to attend, as we hope for this to be an open and generative discussion.

**Where: Stony Brook University, Humanities Building, Room 2052**


**When: Wednesday, February 19, 2014, 2pm**
