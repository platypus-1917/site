An Urgent Exchange:

U.S. Empire

Islamic Fundamentalism

Both Deadly.

Is There Another Way?


## Wednesday, April 27 6:30 pm

## Tishman Auditorium, The New School, 66 W. 12th Street, New York City

A diverse group of artists, scholars, and political thinkers including Wafaa Bilal, Laura Lee Schmidt and Sunsara Taylor will engage the question:

â€œIf you are troubled about the state and direction of the worldâ€¦if you are repelled by both the arrogant assertion of empire by the government and leaders of the U.S. and the fanatical backwardness of Islamic fundamentalism, what should you be doing?â€?

Uprisings in the Middle East have given renewed hope to many. But the U. S. continues to rain down death on the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan and occupy Iraq, seeking, with its European allies, to dominate Libya through military intervention. Islamic fundamentalism, presenting itself as an â€œalternativeâ€? to Western domination, puts a brake on the radical aspirations of people, especially women.

Come and be part of the conversation about alternatives to these two unacceptable options " in a world crying out for fundamental change.
