May Day was great! We talked to a TON of people, marched with friends and comrades all the way from Union Square down to Liberty Plaza for International Workers' Day -- ran into David Graeber, Todd Gitlin, and many others! We made a lot of contacts, distributed the latest issue of *[The Platypus Review](category/pr/featured/)* and invited everyone to our **[MAY 2: The Day After](https://newyork.platypus1917.org/may-2-the-day-after/ "MAY 2: The Day After")** event. More pictures will be up soon!
