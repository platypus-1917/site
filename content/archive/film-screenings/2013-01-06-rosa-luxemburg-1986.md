The Crisis of German Social Democracy (1915) "Socialism is the first
popular movement in world history that has set itself the goal of
bringing human consciousness, and thereby free will, into play in the
social actions of mankind. . . . The victory of socialism will not
descend from heaven. The international proletariat . . . will take the
tiller of social life and become the pilot to the goal of its own
history."
