In *EXAMINED LIFE* (2008, 87 minutes, Canada, DVD), filmmaker Astra Taylor accompanies some of today's most influential thinkers on a series of unique excursions through places and spaces that hold particular resonance for them and their ideas.

This event is presented in association with the [Platypus Affiliated Society](), New York chapter. Platypus organizes reading groups, public fora, research and journalism focused on problems and tasks inherited from the "Old" (1920s-30s), "New" (1960s-70s) and post-political (1980s-90s) Left for the possibilities of emancipatory politics today.
