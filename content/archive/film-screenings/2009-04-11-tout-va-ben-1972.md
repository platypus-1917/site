In anticipation of the Left Forum (April 17-19), Platypus NYC would like to invite our friends on the Left to a screening of TOUT VA B!EN (1972), Godard and Gorin's story of a man, a woman, a country and an occupation.We hope the discussion of this film can serveÂ to regroup and coordinate our efforts inÂ preparation for the Left Forum. We would like to raise the question: What role should the Left Forum play in the building of a student Left, and how can we be most effective in bringing this shift about?

The Platypus Affiliated Society will participate in two panel discussions at this years Left Forum 2009: Turning Points. The first panel, led by and composed of Platypus members, "Dialectics of Defeat: Towards a Theory of Historical Regression," will be held on April 18, 5-7:00pm. The second, a collaboration between former USAS members and Platypus members who will present alongside a current SDS and New School RSU member, "Politics of the Contemporary Student Left: Hopes and Failures,"will be held on April 18, 12-2:00pm.

The Platypus Affiliated Society, established in December 2006, organizes reading groups, public fora, film screenings, research and journalism focused on problems and tasks inherited from the "Old" (1920s-30s), "New" (1960s-70s) and post-political (1980s-90s) Left for the possibilities of emancipatory politics today.
