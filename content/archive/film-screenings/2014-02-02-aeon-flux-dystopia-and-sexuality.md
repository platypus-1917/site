As a corollary to the [Gender and Sexuality reading group](http://chicago.platypus1917.org/gender-and-sexuality/), Platypus will be screening Aeon Flux, the animated television series that aired on MTV in the 90s and has since become an avant garde cult classic in both the genres of animation and science fiction.

In each episode, violence, sexuality, and cold-war espionage intermingle as Aeon Flux, a mysterious secret agent clad in dominatrix-styled leather, infiltrates the totalitarian police state of Monica in her crusades against its dictator, Trevor Goodchild, her nemesis and occasional lover.
