KANYE WEST FAMOUSLY INDICTED PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH for "not caring about black people." Mr. West now says that it's the Democrats who don't care about black people. But he thinks that Trump does indeed care.

West, who received an honorary doctoral degree from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago a few years ago, intends to move back to Chicago from Hollywood, which he describes as The Sunken Place.

West's wife Kim Kardashian convinced President Trump to free Alice Johnson, a black grandmother, from jail, and to initiate the criminal justice sentencing reform legislation called the "First Step Act." Prisoners are being released to join the workforce in which the demand for labor has been massively increased in the economic recovery under the Trump Administration. The reason for any such reform now, after the end of the Great Recession, will be this demand for workers --- no longer the need to warehouse the unemployed.

Trump ran on and won election calling for "jobs, jobs, jobs!," and now defines his Republican Party as standing for the "right to life and the dignity of work," which was his definition of what "Make America Great Again" meant to him. This will be the basis now for his reelection in November 2020, for "promises kept."

The current impeachment farce is indeed what Trump calls it: the Democrats motivated by outrage at his exposure of their shameless political corruption, with the Biden family prominently featured. After trouncing the infamous Clintons in 2016, Trump is keeping this drumbeat going for 2020. Don't expect it to stop. The Democrats have wanted to impeach Trump from the moment he was elected, indeed even beforehand, but finally got around to it when Trump exposed them --- exposed their "frontrunner."

Trump has held out the offer of bipartisan cooperation on everything from trade to immigration reform. He went so far as to say, when congratulating the Democrats on their 2018 midterm election victories, that he would be potentially more able to realize his agenda with a Democrat-majority Congress, because he would no longer have to face resistance from established mainstream Republicans opposed to his policies. In his State of the Union Address to Congress this year, Trump contrasted the offer of negotiation and cooperation with the threat of investigations. As it turns out, the FBI, CIA and other U.S. government security services personnel who have tried to indict Trump out of political opposition are now finding themselves the targets of criminal investigation. At least some of them are likely go to prison. The bloated national security state is dismayed and in retreat in the face of Trump. --- Good!

What is the argument against Trump's reelection? That he is utterly unbearable as a President of the United States? That Trump must be stopped because the world is running out of time? Either in terms of the time spent by separated children being held under atrocious conditions in appalling immigration detention centers, or that of glaciers falling into the ocean? Both of these will continue unabated, with or without Trump. The Democrats neither can nor will put a stop to such things --- not even slow them.

What is the argument for electing the Democrats, then? A Green New Deal? --- Will never happen: Obama promised it already in 2008. That they will restore "civility" to American life? Like we had under Obama? In other words, the same conditions, but with a comforting smile instead of an irritating smirk?

![](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/assets/trump-pelosi-shade-1.png){.wp-image-33263}

But Trump's supporters became annoyed with Obama, and have been reassured by Trump's confidence in America: Trump's smile is not sarcastic; Obama's often was. Don't the Democrats deserve that grin?

Will the Democrats provide free quality health care for all? --- Not on your life!

Neither will Trump. But not because he doesn't want to: he definitely does; he thinks that it's absurd that the wealthiest country in world history cannot provide for its citizens. But what can you do?

The last time national health care was floated as a proposal was by Nixon. But it was defeated by Democrats as well as Republicans. Nixon floated UBI (Universal Basic Income), too --- but it was opposed by the Democrats, especially by their labor unions, who --- rightly --- said that employers would use it as an excuse to pay workers that much less. Abortion was legalized when fewer workers were needed.

But that was a different time --- before the general economic downturn after 1973 that led to the last generation of neoliberalism, austerity and a society of defensive self-regard and pessimism. Now, it is likely we are heading into a new generation-long period of capitalist growth --- and optimism. --- At least, it's possible. Nixon and Mao agreed that "what the Left proposes we [the Right] push through."

Are we on the brink of a new, post-neoliberal Progressive era, then? Don't count on it --- at least not with the Democrats! They won't let their Presidential nominee next year be Bernie Sanders. --- Probably, they won't even let it be Warren, either. And anyway, after Obama, no one is really going to believe them. Even if Bernie were to be elected President, he would face a hostile Democratic Party as well as Republicans in Congress. It's unlikely the Squad of AOC et al. will continue to be reelected at all, let alone expand their ranks of Democratic "socialists" in elected office. The DSA (Democratic Socialists of America) have already peaked, even before the thankless misery of canvassing for Democrats --- not "socialists" --- in the next election. The future belongs not to them, but to Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping hosted by Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Climate change must be stopped by China.

(The clearest indicator of American counties voting for Trump in 2016 was density of military families --- not due to patriotism but war fatigue: Trump has fulfilled his promise to withdraw from the War on Terror interventions while funding the military, and is the peace President that Obama was supposed to be, drawing down and seeking negotiated settlements with everyone from North Korea to the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Taliban in Afghanistan; the Neocons are out and flocking to the Democrats.)

The arguments against Trump by the Democrats have been pessimistic and conservative, distrustful and even suspicious of American voters --- to which he opposes an unflappable confidence and optimism, based in faith in American society. Trump considers those who vote against him to be mistaken, not enemies. But the Democrats consider Trump voters to be inimical --- deplorable and even irredeemable.

My Muslim friends who oppose Trump --- half of them support Trump --- said that after his election in 2016 they found their neighbors looking at them differently --- suspiciously. But I think it made them look at Americans differently --- suspiciously. But it's the same country that elected Obama twice.

If Trump's America is really the hateful place Democrats paint it to be, for instance at their LGBTQ+ CNN Town Hall, at which protesters voiced the extreme vulnerability of "trans women of color," then it must be admitted that such violence is perpetrated primarily not by rich straight white men so much as by "cis-gendered heterosexual men --- and women --- of color." --- Should we keep them in jail?

The Democrats' only answer to racism, sexism and homophobia is to fire people and put them in prison. --- Whereas Trump lets them out of jail to give them a job. 

Perhaps their getting a job will help us, too.

So: Why not Trump again? | **P**
