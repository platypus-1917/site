_Presented at the Left Forum 2018 on the panel "Has 'the Left' Accommodated Trump (and Putin)? A Debate," with Ravi Bali, Brendan Cooney, Anne Jaclard, Daphne Lawless and Bill Weinberg, organized by the Marxist-Humanist Initiative at John Jay College in NYC on June 2, 2018. A video recording of the event is available online at: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUvBeXO02JY">https://youtu.be/tUvBeXO02JY</a>._

AS A MARXIST academic professional and a gay man living in a Northern city, married to a nonwhite Muslim immigrant, it would have been beneficial to me for Hillary Clinton to have been elected President of the U.S. That would have served my personal interests. No doubt about it.

I am opposed to all of Trump's policies.

I am especially opposed to Trump on his signature issue, immigration. But I was opposed to Obama on this as well, and would have been opposed to Hillary too. I am opposed to DACA and its hierarchy of supposedly "deserving" recipients. "Full citizenship rights for all workers!"

One response to Trump's "Make America Great Again!" was a Mexican nationalist slogan, "Make America Mexico again!" But, as a Marxist, I go one step further: I am for the union of Mexico and the U.S. under one government -- the dictatorship of the proletariat. But Trump made Rudy Giuliani and Jeff Sessions wear hats saying "Make Mexico Great Again Also." This was wholly sincere, at least on Trump's part but probably also for Sessions and Giuliani. Why not? If I am opposed to making America great again, then I suppose I am also opposed to making Mexico great, too.[^1]

For the purposes of the struggle for socialism I seek to pursue, I wish Hillary had won the election. All the anti-Trump protest going on is a distraction from the necessary work, and, worse, Trump feeds discontent into the Democrats as the party of "opposition." With Hillary in office, this would have been less the case -- however, we must remember that, had she won, Hillary still would have faced a Republican Congressional majority, and so we would have still heard about how important it would be to elect Democrats this year!

I am opposed to Trump's law-and-order conservatism. Not that I am against law and order per se, mind you, and perhaps I am not even so opposed to the order and law of society as it is now. I play by the rules and follow the law. Why wouldn't I? -- And, anyway, honestly, who here doesn't: "rebels," all?

But I am aware that laws are selectively enforced and that the social order is run by those who don't always play by the rules -- don't always play by their own rules! I am aware that the social order and the law are used as excuses for things that are not so lawful and orderly, for things that are not so social. I am aware of Trump's demagogy.

But it is funny watching the established social and political order go into fits over Trump's insistence on law and order!

Trump's election gave the "Left" something to do -- they should be grateful! They would have been bored under Hillary. Especially after 8 years of Obama. "Fascism" is much more exciting, isn't it?

I would have been grateful if Hillary had been elected instead -- _Saturday Night Live_'s jokes about Hillary are much funnier than about Trump.

My family voted for Trump -- mostly. My mother and my brother and his wife voted for Trump. But my father voted for Hillary. When Hillary collapsed due to fatigue from pneumonia, my father dutifully went to get his pneumonia shot. But my mother previously had voted twice for Obama; I'm not sure if my father did, too -- he might have voted for McCain and Romney.

In the primaries, I intended to vote for Bernie, but it turned out the Democrats sent the wrong ballots to my precinct (which was more likely to vote for Bernie than other precincts: I thus personally witnessed in action the Democrats' suppression of votes for Bernie in the primaries), so I went to the (empty) Republican line and voted for Trump. -- In November, too: I knew that Hillary would win Illinois, but I wanted her to win by one vote less: no sense rewarding the Democrats for being greedy.

I expected Trump to win.

From the very moment that Trump descended the golden escalator and announced his candidacy, I thought he could win. As time went on, I increasingly thought that he would win.

I had mixed feelings about this.

On the one hand, I dreaded the shit-show that ensued in Trump's campaign and that I knew would only get worse if he was elected.

But on the other hand, I felt an obligation as a teacher to prepare my students for Trump's victory. -- If he had not won, nothing would have been lost: my students didn't require any special preparation for a Clinton Presidency. But if Trump won, I knew that there would be a great deal of confusion -- and scare-mongering by the Democrats. I couldn't stand by and watch my students be lied to.

I had lived through the Reagan Revolution and watched _The Day After_ on television along with everyone else. I heard Reagan denounced as a "fascist" by the "Left" and experienced the multiple anti-climaxes of Mondale and Dukakis. The world hadn't ended. As an adult, I lived through the George W. Bush Presidency, 9/11 and the War on Terror, the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the financial crash, and the "change we can believe in," the election of the First Black President. In all that time, not much changed. At least not much attributable to the Presidency.

So I didn't expect much to change with Trump either.

But I did expect a lot of hysterics in response. I knew that my students would be scared. I wanted to protect them from that.

So I sought to get out ahead of it.

My students asked me to write a statement on the election in the beginning of the new academic year before the election, something short that could be handed out as a flyer.

So I wrote, "Why not Trump?"[^2] -- which is why I was invited here to speak to you now: to answer for my alleged crime. It was not an endorsement, nor an equivocation, but an honest question: Why not Trump? Perhaps it was too philosophical.

As I wrote in that article, I thought that the mendacity of the status quo defending itself against Trump was a greater threat than Trump himself. I was prompted to re-read Hannah Arendt's article on the Pentagon Papers, "Lying in Politics:" she said that the ability to lie was inextricably connected to the ability to create new things and change the world.

I don't know.

I did find however a difference in quality and character between Trump's lies and the Democrats'.

The only argument I found for Hillary was that we lived in the "best of all possible worlds" -- as Voltaire's Professor Pangloss described it in _Candide_. I didn't want to be Professor Pangloss. I wanted to spare my students that.

But perhaps we did live in the best of all possible worlds under Obama, and would have continued to do so under Hillary. Perhaps Trump really has ruined everything for everyone. Perhaps the world has come to an end.

I don't know.

I wish Hillary had won -- so I could have found out. | **P**
