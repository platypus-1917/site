## Description

Crisis: Pathol. The point in the progress of a disease when an important development or change takes place which is decisive of recovery or death. "...Existing strategies and theories seem inadequate in a bewildering contemporary political scene. Disparate groups have begun to show an interest in rethinking the fundamentals of Left politics..." Many on the Left feel a sense of crisis. Existing strategies and theories seem inadequate in a bewildering contemporary political scene. Disparate groups have begun to show an interest in rethinking the fundamentals of Left politics. The Platypus Affiliated Society seeks to make the conversation explicit, and to host a series of discussions about the crisis of the contemporary Left: its quality, causes, and significance for future reconstitution and transformation. Across five cities worldwide, we've invited figures from across the Left -- academics, political organizers, theorists -- to answer and debate six fundamental questions. We also pose these questions to the Left as a whole and invite responses from all quarters. The questions below stem from confusion; taking nothing for granted, we hope that confronting this confusion might open up future possibilities for renewed consciousness and practice on the Left. Speaker

## Questions

1. How would you define the Left?

2. Do you think the Left is in crisis? If so, then what constitutes the crisis?

3. In trying to understand the contemporary Left, what history matters most? What tasks and problems have we inherited from the Old Left and the New Left?

4. Could the Left have done something to avoid its current impasses? If so, what?

5. What is the relationship between the Left and anti-capitalism? Between the Left and Marxism? What should it be? How does the Left need to change? Who is responsible for making the change happen?
