title: 'Read and Discuss January 18th texts: The Absence of the Left'

---
## [**January 18**, 2009]

> However difficult the task of grasping and confronting global capital might be, it is crucially important that a global internationalism be recovered and reformulated... None of the massive demonstrations against the war featured oppositional progressive Iraqis who could provide a more nuanced and critical perspective on the Middle East, a telling political failure on the part of the Left. (Postone 2006)

> We have to note, with regret, that the Iraqi democratic forces have not received, in their difficult struggle, effective solidarity and support from international forces of the Left. (Iraqi Communist Party 2006)
