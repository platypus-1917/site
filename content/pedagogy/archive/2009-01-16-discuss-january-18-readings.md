1960s paths not taken (2): gender, sexuality and revolution


>The situation of women is different from that of any other social group. This is because they are not one of a number of isolable units, but half a totality: the human species... They are fundamental to the human condition, yet in their economic, social and political roles, they are marginal. It is precisely this combination "fundamental and marginal at one and the same time" that has been fatal to them. (Juliet Mitchell, 1966)
