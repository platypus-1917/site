Description:
"I became a Trotskyist in 1933. The
theory of state capitalism is a development of Trotsky's position....
But at the end of the Second World War, the perspectives that Trotsky
had put forward were not realized. Trotsky wrote that one thing was
certain, the Stalinist bureaucracy would not survive the war. It would
either be overthrown by revolution or by counterrevolution.... The
assumption was that the collapse of the Stalinist bureaucracy would be a
fantastic opening for the Trotskyist movement, for the Fourth
International. The Stalinist bureaucracy not only didn't collapse but it
expanded.... Therefore, at that time, Stalinism had a fantastic
strength. And we had to come to terms with it.'
---Tony Cliff,
interview with Ahmed Shawki (1997)

Tony Cliff's recognition in his
own moment of a certain kind of impasse within Trotskyism and his
attempt to overcome it require full consideration and appreciation both
in terms of the merits of its potential and a consciousness of its
limits. Panelists will address this legacy for the Left today.

Description:
"No coarser insult, no baser defamation,
can be thrown against the workers than the remark, Theoretical
controversies are for the intellectuals'"
---Rosa Luxemburg, Reform r
Revolution (1900)

"Since there can be no talk of an independent
ideology formulated by the working masses themselves in the process of
their movement the only choice is -- either bourgeois or socialist
ideology... This does not mean, of course, that the workers have no part
in creating such an ideology. They take part, however, not as workers,
but as socialist theoreticians, as Proudhons and Weitlings; in other
words, they take part only when they are able, and to the extent that
they are able, more or less, to acquire the knowledge of their age and
develop that knowledge."
---Vladimir Lenin, What is to be Done?
(1905)

"The liquidation of theory by dogmatization and thought
taboos contributed to the bad practice."
---Adorno, Negative
Dialectics (1966)

This discussion will reflect on the relationship
between revolutionary politics and thinking in the past and present and
ask why has it become increasingly difficult to render political life
intellectual and intellectual life political today? Panelists will
consider the historical role of revolutionary theory as a moment of
revolutionary politics, and the ways in which thinking can be held
responsible for politics, and politics held responsible for thinking.
