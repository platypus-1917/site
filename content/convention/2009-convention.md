*What has the Left been and what can it become?*

## June 12th-14th, 2009

### School of the Art Institute of Chicago 112 S. Michigan Ave

This is the first annual Platypus International Convention, which will take place at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. As a three-day convention, there will be a series of lectures, workshops, and round-table discussions among members of the Platypus Affiliated Society and the interested public. Each event deals with historical and contemporary sociopolitical and cultural issues that played a role in shaping the development and downfall of the Left as we know it. Our intention is to hold a conversation on all the work Platypus has done as a group since its founding in 2006.
