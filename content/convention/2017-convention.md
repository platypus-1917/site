The long anticipated outcome of the 2016 US Presidential Election -- the
coronation of Hillary Clinton -- was dramatically derailed by the twin
"populist" insurgencies of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Many on the
Left hoped the Sanders campaign would either transform the Democratic
Party, replacing the neoliberalism of the Clintons with a commitment to
social democracy, or form a new left-wing party. Yet Sanders supported
Clinton in the end, and the Democrats relied upon their McGovernite
coalition of minorities, women, and organized labor constituencies in
the general election.

Trump, on the other hand, was a challenge to
the Republican status quo, breaking with Reagan coalition orthodoxies
while appealing to working class voters who had supported Obama and
might have supported Sanders. While Sanders appealed to the broad
discontent with established political leadership and the social decline
over which it presided, only Trump managed to capture the potential this
presented.

Far from opposing capitalism, Sanders sought a retreat
from neoliberalism into New Deal-style reforms, while Trump campaigned
on a vision of capitalism beyond both Roosevelt and Reagan, proposing to
lead the capitalist class for the benefit of the workers. Trump treats
capitalism as a political question which, while posed at the level of
the state, can only be resolved in and through civil society.
Capitalism, for Trump, can solve its own problems, so long as the
workers are politically represented. Trump demonstrates that capitalism
remains a palpable political problem, while failing to point beyond it.
The 20th century began with the crisis of Marxism, whose political task
of overcoming capitalism was subsequently never realized. Is Marxism
necessary, and able, to show the way forward?

We ask the
panelists to consider the following questions:

What can the Left do
to advance the struggle for socialism under such
circumstances?

Does the re-emergence of politics, along with
decline of both "parties of the ruling class" present an opening for
Marxism in the "Age of Trump" to pursue anew a course towards party
politics?

Why has Trump incited such hysteria on the Left? How do
we make sense of this phenomenon?

What would it mean to oppose
Trump from the Left?

The bourgeois revolutions strove to subordinate the power of the state
to the interests of civil society. Yet the revolutions of 1848
disappointed, resulting in the recrudescence of the state, which rose
above society to maintain "order." Revolutionaries were divided over how
to respond. Could the state serve as a means of emancipation? Or was it
a force of counter-revolution that had to be smashed? For Marx, the
capitalist or "Bonapartist" state had to be smashed, but this could only
be accomplished by constituting a new state power, a "dictatorship of
the proletariat", that could realize the emancipatory potential
unleashed by capitalism. Instead of either accepting or rejecting it,
the proletariat had to render the function of the Bonapartist state
self-critical.

In his 1875 Critique of the Gotha Program, Marx
warned his followers against regressing to the Lassallean affirmation of
the state. Such capitulation was an ever-present risk, tempting the
workers to support the political reconstitution of capitalism through
state power, rather than the overcoming of both capitalism and the state
through social revolution.

After World War I, organized labor was
increasingly integrated into the state. In supporting the New Deal,
Communists deferred to capitalist state welfare, downplaying the goal of
revolution. In 1935 the National Labor Relations Act, in aiming to
protect the rights of workers, subordinated organized labor to the
state, which had to balance these rights against the "interest of the
public in the free flow of commerce." As the AFL and CIO became core
constituencies of the Democratic party, the class struggle was
repudiated, in favor of a partnership of Labor and Capital brokered by
the state.

While the New Left initially reacted against this
parochial arrangement, the 70s witnessed a turn toward militant labor
organizing, particularly in the public sector. However, this
"grassroots upsurge" coincided with the decline of the welfare state
and the rise of neoliberalism, whose champions -- Democrat as well as
Republican -- used state power to launch an assault on the labor
movement.

How does the State function today? How is it the product
of a history of Leftist struggles? Is there a way in which workers in
the "Era of Trump" are able make sense of and redeem Labor's history
with the State, to develop, as Marxists contend, a dialectical, rather
than affirmative or negative relation to the State?

***Liberalism and Socialism***

In her seminal 1900 pamphlet, Reform or Revolution?, Rosa Luxemburg
stated that if the socialist movement lost sight of its final goal,
there would be nothing to distinguish it from liberal politics. Yet she
also claimed that the desiderata of liberalism could only be fulfilled
through the struggle for socialism. Though still widely read,
Luxemburg's critique has only grown more enigmatic as the relationship
of these two competing ideologies blurred in the 20th century.

The
1930's Popular Front alliance of Communist Parties and liberals,
initially conceived as a temporary strategy to defeat Fascism, proved to
be a lasting reformist coalition. Socialism regressed from a politics of
social revolution to a seemingly more radical version of the liberal
protest against exploitation and oppression. When the working-class and
its trade-union leadership began to lose their radical veneer, the
1960's New Left sought new revolutionary subjects in the social
movements coalescing around race, gender, and sexuality, seemed to offer
a radicalism surpassing the liberal-labor alliance of the time. Yet the
70's saw the integration of the New Left into the political
establishment by way of the Democratic Party, paralleling the fate of
the Communists. Now, liberals champion the new social movements, to
which socialists ostensibly oppose a "class-first" perspective.

In
the recent election, Clinton represented the neoliberal establishment
which opposed identity politics to the "working class" concerns voiced
by Sanders. For Clinton supporters, the Sandernistas were "Brocialists"
who reduced the problems of society to economics, neglecting other forms
of oppression.

How do both camps fall short of the fulfillment
of all liberal desiderata? What would it take for a Left to define
itself beyond liberal politics? In what ways is the contemporary Left's
relation to the Democratic Party a legacy of previous capitulations to
liberalism? How has the lack of a self-conscious Left opened the way for
regressive movements to fill the void of emancipatory politics? How can
the Left oppose the establishment parties without simply replacing
them?

The First World War manifested an economic, social and political
crisis of global capitalism, -- "imperialism" -- which sparked reflection
in the mass parties of the Second International on the task of socialist
politics. The revisionist dispute, the "crisis of Marxism" in which
Lenin, Luxemburg and Trotsky first cut their teeth, shaped their
understanding of the unfolding revolution as a necessary expression of
self-contradiction within the movement for socialism. Even the most
revolutionary party produced its own conservatism, hence the need for
self-conscious, revolutionary leadership to avoid "tailing" the
movement.

Lenin, Luxemburg and Trotsky thought that leadership
adequate to the revolution of 1917 required historical consciousness.
They drew upon Marx's appraisal of the democratic revolutions of 1848,
in which Marx identified the historical contradiction which had
developed in bourgeois society and necessitated the dictatorship of the
proletariat. The Bolsheviks maintained that a "bourgeois-democratic"
revolution could spark a workers' socialist revolution in Europe,
subsequently allowing for a struggle for socialism. Lenin held that
political forms such as "the state" and "the party" must be transformed
in and through revolution. Yet the meaning of 1917 was already
contentious in 1924, as Trotsky recognized in his pamphlet, Lessons of
October. Trotsky would spend the rest of his life fighting "over the
heads of the leaders of the Second and Third Internationals]" to
maintain socialist consciousness.

Whether in the Popular Fronts of
the 1930's, the Chinese Communists in 1949, or the New Left of the
1960's, the Left sought to understand itself -- both positively and
negatively -- in relation to the aims and outcomes of 1917. The
historical consciousness of its primary actors disintegrated into
various oppositions: Lenin the Machiavellian versus Luxemburg the
democratic Cassandra; socialism versus liberalism; authoritarianism
versus libertarianism. Meanwhile, the futility of the politics shared by
Lenin and Luxemburg has been naturalized. It is tacitly accepted that
what Lenin and Luxemburg jointly aspired to achieve, if not already
impossible a century ago, is certainly impossible today. The premises of
the revolution itself have been cast in doubt.

· What were the aims of the 1917 Russian Revolution?

· What was the self-understanding of its Marxist leadership?

· How has the memory of 1917 changed in the course of the 20th century?

· Why does the legacy of 1917 appear arrayed in oppositions?

· Are we still tasked by the memory of 1917 today, and if so how?

· In what way, if any, does the present moment present a new opportunity to reassess 1917 and the self-understanding of Lenin, Luxemburg and Trotsky?
