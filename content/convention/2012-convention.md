## The 1990s-2000s: combined legacies of the recent history of the Left for today.

The two decades of the 1990s 2000s form a cycle containing certain common as well as differing concerns. The second decade of the 21st century has begun under the mixed legacy of recent history, presenting important problems needing to be worked through, moving forward.

For Platypus' 2012 international convention, two plenary panels will ask speakers from various perspectives to bring their experience of the Left's recent history to bear on today's political possibilities and challenges.

Registration $20
