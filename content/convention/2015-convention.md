## Panel Description
Leftists today lament the strength of neoliberal hegemony. The use of
"hegemony" underlines the ideological dimension of the neoliberal order;
it suggests that mass ideological legitimacy -- and not the triumph of
pure force or of back-door machinations -- has made neoliberalism
politically possible. What were the ideological shifts in political and
social consciousness that provided the grounds for contemporary
neoliberal hegemony? What role did the Left play in this historical
transformation of mass consciousness? Freedom, the rallying cry of
socialism, serves now as the stated ideology of the upward
redistribution of wealth. The past decades have seen stagnating wages
and a widening income disparity -- although women, LGBT people, people of
color, and others who once faced legally enforced, identity-based social
exclusion now appear to be more "free" than they were during the
pre-neoliberal period of high Fordism. These two aspects of
neoliberalism, its identitarian inclusiveness and its anti-working class
agenda, appear to go hand-in-hand. Despite the dubious, partial success
of the politics of the New Left, we are probably farther than we have
ever been from the goal of global socialism. In light of this history,
how can we imagine a future for the Left? How could the Left move beyond
organizing the expression of frustrated expectations within
neoliberalism -- beyond organizing the left wing of neoliberalism
itself -- to generate the kind of theory and practice required to
politically overcome capitalism?

# The American Left and the "Black Question": From Politics to Protest to the Post-political*

112 S. Michigan Ave | Room 620

## Panelists

- Toby Chow (University of Chicago)
- Brandon Johnson (Chicago Teachers Union)
- August Nimtz (University of Minnesota)
- Adolph Reed, Jr. (University of Pennsylvania)

## Panel Description
Beneath a consensus of avowed anti-racism, the American Left remains
conflicted about whether and how to politicize race. This panel seeks to
shed historical light on today's political impasses, asking: How has
racism changed throughout U.S. history, and to what degree has racism
been overcome in America? Our neoliberal and post-political present has
been shaped by key periods of political conflict over race and racism,
from the failure of the post-Civil War Reconstruction era through the
entrenchment of Jim Crow through the abolition of legal racial
segregation with the Civil Rights Movement. If we have overcome the
forms of legalized racism that plagued American society before the
1960s, this victory has nevertheless failed to translate into the
meaningful improvement of living conditions for the vast majority of
black people in America. Instead, the general downturn since the early
1970s has been managed in a way that has worsened conditions for most
black people in the context of a broader stratification and
brutalization of American society. This situation demands a strident
refutation of the pseudo-problem of "class versus race;" we ask
today's left to consider the implications of Adolph Reed's formulation
that "racism is a class issue." With a view to how a politics of
freedom would approach race and racism, what lessons can be drawn from
the most significant periods in the history of the American Left, such
as the populist movement, the pre-WWI Socialist Party, the 1920s-30s
Communist Party, and the 1960s-70s New Left? If the problem of racism
has been bypassed but not overcome, leaving in place the structural
conditions that have shaped racism historically, how might we recognize
these structural conditions and thereby render race and racism
politically tractable?



***Electoral Politics and the Left: Problems and
Prospects*** 112 S. Michigan Ave. | Room 920
- Scott Hiley, Communist Party, USA
- Jorge Mújica, Chicago Socialist Campaign (USA)
- ​Tom Riley International Bolshevik Tendency (Canada)

## Panel Description
During the 19th century, suffrage rights were widened in the heart of
capital, confronting political radicals with the question of whether and
how elective offices could be used to achieve revolutionary aims. Since
that time, differences of opinion on how to approach electoral politics
have been at issue throughout the Left's most fundamental splits: the
break between Marxism and anarchism; the apparent capitulation of
international social democracy to capitalist war and, later, to
capitalist stabilization; the struggle for the legacy of the Russian
Revolution, fought between Trotskyism and Stalinism and, later, Maoism.
Since the era of Lenin and Debs, such splits have attended the decline
of the Left rather than its ascendancy, forcing recent generations of
marginalized radicals to grapple with an impossible choice: either a
"realistic" electoral compromise with the status quo, often couched
in the logic of "lesser evilism," or a "sectarian" electoral purism
doomed to irrelevance, often inspired by fidelity to once-revolutionary
"correct positions." This impasse guarantees a hearing for those who,
like many Occupy movement activists, advocate a principled abstention
from electoral politics. What are the uses, limits, promises, and perils
of electoral campaigns and elective offices for Leftist politics? Should
the Left aim to "set the clock back" 100 years to the era of mass
electoral parties for socialism in the heart of capital? Is something on
this order still necessary, and if so, how could it yet be possible?
Does electoral politics figure in our emancipation beyond capitalism?




# Can there be a working class culture and experience?

112 S. Michigan ave. | Room 707

- Walter Benn Michaels (University of Illinois, Chicago)
- Juan Conatz, Recomposition (USA)
- Paul Elitzik (*FNewsMagazine*, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, USA)
- Jacob Denz, Graduate Student Organizing Committee, GSOC-UAW local 2110 (NYU, USA)

## Panel Description
The 20th century left gave rise to the recurring idea that a homogeneous
working class experience could culminate in a revolutionary 'working
class culture.' Various movements sought to create artworks that would
transcend the apparently decadent forms characteristic of bourgeois
culture; these movements ranged from the USSR's 1920s Proletkult to the
Mexican muralists and American Artist Union of the 1930s to the Art
Workers Coalition in the 1960s-70s. However, the merits and potentiality
of a coherent working-class culture have been thrown into question by
the failure of all of these projects to transform society in an
emancipatory direction, despite their revolutionary intentions. This
panel seeks to explore the concept of working class culture, its
history, and what it might mean for the Left today.



# Democracy and the Left

 112 S. Michigan ave. | Room 920

- Mike Macnair, CPGB (UK)
- August Nimtz (University of Minnesota)
- Aaron Smeaton (Groupe Internationaliste Ouvriere, Internationalist Communist Tendency)
- Peter Staudenmaier (Institute for Social Ecology)

## Panel Description
From the financial crisis and the bank bail-outs to the question of
"sovereign debt"; from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street; from the
struggle for a unified European-wide policy to the elections in Greece
and Egypt that seem to have threatened so much and promised so little ---
the need to go beyond mere "protest" has asserted itself: political
revolution is in the air, again.At the same time, the impending
general election in the U.S. seems, by comparison, to be a non-event,
despite potentially having far-reaching consequences for teeming issues
worldwide. Today, the people -- the demos -- seem resigned to their
political powerlessness, even as they rage against the corruption of
politics. Hence, while contemporary demands for democracy to politicize
the demos, they are also indicative of social and political regression
that asks urgently for recognition and reflection. Demands for democracy
"from below" end up being expressed "from above": The 99%, in its
already obscure and unorganized character, didn't express itself as such
in the various recent elections, but was split in various tendencies,
many of them very reactionary.Democracy retains an enigmatic
character, since it always slips any fixed form and content, since
people under the dynamic of capital keep demanding at times "more"
democracy and "real" democracy. But democracy can be like Janus: it
often expresses both the progressive social and emancipatory demands,
but also their defeat, their hijacking by an elected
"Bonaparte".What is the history informing the demands for greater
democracy today, and how does the Left adequately promote -- or not -- the
cause of popular empowerment?What are the potential futures for
"democratic" revolution, especially as understood by the Left?

7:00 - 9:00pm

# ​CLOSING PLENARY: *WHAT IS POLITICAL PARTY FOR THE LEFT?*

SAIC Columbus Auditorium, 280 S Columbus Dr Chicago

- Chris Cutrone, Platypus
- Mike Macnair, CPGB (UK)
- Adolph Reed, Jr. (University of Pennsylvania, USA)
- Tom Riley, International Bolshevik Tendency (Canada)

## Panel Description
In spite of many different political currents and tendencies the most
significant question informing the "Left" today is the issue of
"political party." Various "Left unity" initiatives have been
taking place in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis and subsequent
downturn, following Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring, alongside
continuing "post-political" tendencies inherited from the 1980s-90s,
perspectives such as expressed by Hardt and Negri's Empire, Multitude,
and Commonwealth, John Holloway's Change the World without Taking Power,
the Invisible Committee's The Coming Insurrection, the California
student protestors' Communique from an Absent Future, the formation of
SYRIZA in Greece, and the new party Podemos in Spain rejecting the
organized "Marxist Left" as well as the established labor unions as
part of the existing "political caste." In Germany, Die Linke
appears poised to break into high political office. At the same time,
there has been a growing crisis of the largest "orthodox Marxist"
("Trotskyist") political organizations in the Anglophone and Western
European countries, which has been characterized as the "crisis of
('actually existing') Leninism" in the developed capitalist countries.
New publications have emerged such as Jacobin magazine, N+1 and Endnotes
journals, as a new "millennial Marxism." And there has emerged a
related discussion of the legacy of Marxism in principles of political
organization going back to the Second International 1889-1914
("neo-Kautskyism"), for instance in Lars Lih's revisionist history
of Lenin and Bolshevism and the Communist Party of Great Britain's
member Mike Macnair's book Revolutionary Strategy (2008), the latter
occasioned by the formations of the Respect Party in the U.K. and the
Nouveau Parti Anticapitaliste in France. Today, perhaps the most
significant question facing the "Left" internationally is the issue
of "political party," raising a question that goes all the way back
to Marx's dispute with the anarchists in the First International: What
would it mean for the Left to take "political action" today?
Today the issue of "political party" seems to generate more problems
for the Left than it solves. Formalized political organization would
appear indispensable for a long term viewpoint beyond the ebb and flow
of movements. Yet the role of the party in sustaining activity and
discontents over time -- of building towards a revolution -- has had, at
best an ambivalent legacy, leading as much to rationalizing politically
ineffective strategies or giving cover for various forms of opportunism
(e.g. reformism, careerism, etc.). Today the idea of political parties
as a means for the Left -- through which the necessity for social
transformation could be developed within society -- as opposed to an end
in itself is difficult to envision both theoretically and practically.
Yet the growing default -- politics without parties -- seems equally
unable to do more than give license to the ebbs and flows through which
capitalism changes, but invariably persists. There appears no escape
from the question of Political Party for the Left.
