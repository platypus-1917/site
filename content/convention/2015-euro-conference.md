Goethe University Frankfurt / Campus Bockenheim (Jügelhaus H V)

The Platypus Affiliated Society is hosting its second ( annual ) European Conference in Frankfurt am Main from November 6-8 . After our Inaugural European Conference in London in 2014, we are meeting again for a critical conversation on the present state of the Left. The present European crisis and the differing answers of the Left will be at the center of the conversation.

In the face of the continuing economic crisis in Europe and the strict austerity measures by EU institutions, the political landscape of Europe has changed considerably. Debates concerning the future and structure of the European Union have been accompanied by social movements, general strikes and the formation of new political parties. Despite massive resistance to austerity measures concentrated in Southern Europe, however, there appears to be great confusion with regard to the European project and thus the also with respect to the question of what demands the Left should make in the context of the new realities of the Economic and Monetary Union, or how the crisis could lay the basis for an emancipatory politics on the Left today.

Although important solidarity movements have arisen, for the most part the various social movements appear isolated from each other politically.

Syriza's struggle with the Troika has emphasized the absence of an international response by the Left.

What does the project of the EU mean for social and political initiatives in Europe? What possibilities and problems does the economic and monetary crisis present in this context? What are the perspectives and the changes which have emerged within the new circumstances for traditional Leftist demands, such as internationalism, the welfare state, or the liberation of women? What does the historical legacy of the European Left mean for contemporary political demands?

Alongside representatives of
different political tendencies and organizations from all over Europe,
we wish to devote ourselves to these and other questions. Activists,
politicians and scholars will discuss the project and failure of the EU,
forms of political organization, the crisis of Social Democracy, the
welfare state, Neo-Keynesianism and the possibilities and difficulties
of a Leftist praxis in the crisis. We are hoping to conduct the
conversation with members of Syriza/Popular Unity, Podemos, Partia Razem
(Poland), CPGB, IBT, SPD, Interventionistische Linken, the Rosa
Luxemburg Foundation and the Institut Solidarische Moderne.

This
conference will seek to create a conversation about the controversial
issue of how to assess and respond to the present crisis in Europe and
thus also of the European and international Left. By addressing the
death and the crisis of the Left, we hope to contribute to the
overcoming of current obstacles to emancipatory politics.

We say: the Left is dead! Long live the Left!

(The conference will take place in English; participation is free.)

"Panel Description
"]
In spite of many different political currents and tendencies, perhaps
the most significant question informing the
"Left
" today is the
issue of
"political party." Various
"Left unity
" initiatives have
been taking place in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis and
subsequent downturn, following Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring,
alongside continuing
"post-political
" tendencies inherited from the
1980s-90s (perspectives such as expressed by Hardt and Negri's Empire,
Multitude, and Commonwealth, John Holloway's Change the World without
Taking Power, the Invisible Committee's The Coming Insurrection, the
California student protestors' Communique from an Absent Future), the
formation of SYRIZA in Greece, and the new party Podemos in Spain (who
reject the organized
"Marxist Left
" as well as the established labor
unions as part of the existing
"political caste
"). In Germany, Die
Linke appears poised to break into high political office. At the same
time, there has been a growing crisis of the largest
"orthodox
Marxist
" (
"Trotskyist
") political organizations in the Anglophone
and Western European countries, which has been characterized as the

"crisis of ('actually existing') Leninism
" in the developed
capitalist countries. New publications have emerged such as Jacobin
magazine, N+1 and Endnotes journals, as a new
"millennial Marxism.
"
And there has emerged a related discussion of the legacy of Marxism in
principles of political organization going back to the Second
International 1889-1914 (
"neo-Kautskyism
"), for instance in Lars
Lih's revisionist history of Lenin and Bolshevism and the Communist
Party of Great Britain's member Mike Macnair's book Revolutionary
Strategy (2008), the latter occasioned by the formations of the Respect
Party in the U.K. and the Nouveau Parti Anticapitaliste in France.
Today, perhaps the most significant question facing the
"Left
"
internationally is goes all the way back to Marx's dispute with the
anarchists in the First International: What would it mean for the Left
to take
"political action
" today?
However, the issue of "political
party" seems to generate more problems for the Left than it solves.
Formalized political organization would appear indispensable for a long
term perspectives beyond the ebb and flow of movements. Yet the role of
a party in sustaining activity and discontents over time -- of building
towards a revolution -- has had, at best an ambivalent legacy, leading
as much to rationalizing politically ineffective strategies or giving
cover for various forms of opportunism (e.g. reformism, careerism,
etc.). Today the idea of political parties as a means for the Left --
through which the necessity for social transformation could be developed
within society -- as opposed to an end in itself, is difficult to
envision both theoretically and practically. Yet the existing default
--politics without parties -- seems unable to do more than give sanction
to the vicissitudes through which capitalism changes, but invariably
persists. Worse still, without parties of its own, the Left is forced to
either passively or actively support or at least place hopes in other
parties. There appears no escaping the question of Political Party for
the Left.

"]
A united and peaceful Europe seemed to be a distant dream for a
generation which went through the experience of war and destruction.
Today, this hope gained shape in the new realities of the European
Union. Despite its official proclamation of peace, social well being and
an "alternative to capitalism and communism" the project finds itself in
a prolonged crisis with uncertain expectations. The Euro-­crisis,
massive austerity and the increasing interference into democratic
principles, a growing division between powerful and weak economies,
Germany's new hegemony and the growing influence of financial capital
appear in stark contrast to the official slogans of "European values and
solidarity".
The desperate struggle of SYRIZA demonstrated the
necessity and seeming impossibility of the Left across Europe to answer
with a politics that would be truly international and go beyond


"resisting austerity." Despite growing social unrest, the deep
ambivalence towards the EU expresses itself in the inability of the Left
to formulate a coherent vision of a political alternative. At the same
time the rejection of the EU is ceded to a growing Right. What is the EU
for the Left today? Should it be overcome on the basis of the EU itself,
or against the EU? The clarification of its nature and appropriate
responses seem to be one of the most pressing issues for the Left on the
continent and beyond.

"Panel Description
"]
During the 19th century, suffrage rights were widened in the heart of
capital, confronting political radicals with the question of whether and
how elective offices could be used to achieve revolutionary aims. Since
that time, differences of opinion on how to approach electoral politics
have been at issue throughout the Left's most fundamental splits: the
break between Marxism and anarchism; the apparent capitulation of
international social democracy to world war; the struggle for the legacy
of the Russian Revolution; to capitalist stabilization and the apparent
apathy to politics that would characterize our time.

Since the
early 20th century such splits have attended the decline of the Left
rather than its ascendancy, forcing recent generations of marginalized
radicals to grapple with an impossible choice: either a
"realistic
"
electoral compromise with the status quo, often couched in the logic of
"lesser evilism," or a
"sectarian
" electoral purism doomed to
irrelevance, often inspired by fidelity to once-revolutionary "correct
positions." This impasse guarantees a hearing for those who, like many
Occupy movement activists, advocate a principled abstention from
electoral politics.

With regard to Europe during the last crisis,
we've witnessed the rise of Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain which
indicate a shift from popular mobilization and movement building, to
electoral strategies and parliamentary representation. The starting
point of these social movements severely criticized existing
parliamentary democracy, yet the idea of facilitating radical causes
through electoral politics and campaigns has recently gained prominence.
This panel tries to bring into question the significance of electoral
politics in a moment when party representation has been largely
delegitimized and disapproved. What are the uses, limits, promises, and
perils of electoral campaigns and elective offices for Leftist politics?

A namesake of Juliet Mitchell's 1966 essay, this panel will explore the
long history of the struggle for women's liberation from the vantage
point of the Left today. Mitchell critiques bourgeois feminist demands
such as the right to work and equal pay to posit the need instead for
equal work. She calls for a politics capable of taking on the
fundamental transformation of society and more immediate demands "in a
single critique of the whole of women's situation." In keeping with the
spirit of this essay, we ask again what the relationship might be
between the struggle for social emancipation and the particular tasks of
feminism? How have Leftists imagined this relationship historically?
What do we make of it today?

While the "woman question" has played
an important role in the history of the Left, its knee-jerk inclusion in
current Leftist politics does not necessarily reflect a greater
understanding of what the struggle for women's liberation might mean
politically. How exactly is it "the longest revolution?" When did it
begin? If the crisis of bourgeois society in the industrial revolution
posed the need for women's freedom as inseparable from the project of
human emancipation, then what do we make of the later separation of the
feminist movement from the workers' movement for socialism? In the
beginning of the 20th Century the woman's movement seems to demand
unitary for political and legal rights, although the bourgeois feminist
movement and the socialist woman's movement where distinctly opposed in
their political perspective. Is the relevance of the conflict gone all
together with a further perspective of the woman's question in
Socialism? What do the seeming successes of feminism tell us when
thought in relation to the failure of the proletarian struggle to
deepen/realize the task of human freedom?

The conditions for the novel political formations of Syriza and Podemos
developed out of the disintegration of the traditional Social Democratic
parties in Greece and Spain. Jeremy Corbyn, the new leader of the Labour
Party in Britain, has argued for greater democracy in the party and
invoked Labour's origins in working-class organization and socialism.
Yet it is unclear exactly what is being remembered by this invocation,
and what is being forgotten. The Bernie Sanders' campaign as a

"socialist
" candidate for leadership of the US Democratic Party
appears equally obscure. Precisely when historical consciousness is most
necessary, the project of Social Democracy seems to be fading from
memory. Little remains of the foundation moment of Social Democracy
today, both in practice and thought.

In the late nineteenth
century, working people's response to capital was expressed in the
political demand for Socialism. This demand galvanized the formation of
European Social Democratic parties guided by the ideology of Marxism.
Among the most influential members of the German Social Democratic
Party, the political leaders of the Second International, agreed that
the primary task of Social Democratic parties was bringing about the
dictatorship of the proletariat, that is, the decisive political
struggle between capital and labor. And while some of these leftist
ultimately found the revolution too risky in the decisive decades of the
1910s and 1920s, even their political judgment is far to the left to
those Social Democratic party members who, after World War II, openly
espoused the integration of workers into a more just and thus more
democratic capitalist order.

Once a global movement for the
self-emancipation of the working class, today's social democratic
parties have fully substituted the task of educating workers in order to
overthrow capitalism, with the task of creating and maintaining the
conditions for a more just market economy. The present standpoint of
social democracy is society as such, bound by national economies and
mediated by the state. Social Democracy today promises to fight social
injustice in the name of the people, but it no longer promises to
realize socialism.

Yet what remains is the name, and with it the
promise and the problem of Social Democracy.
In this panel we would
like to investigate this transformation by looking at the history, the
birth and decline, of Social Democracy. How can we understand the
historical crisis of social democracy for the Left today? How, if at
all, could the trajectory of social democracy shed light on problems yet
to be superseded on the Left today?

## Panel: What is the aim of an educational project?


"To educate stems from the Latin root educare, meaning to lead out. But to lead out of what, conducted by whom, and in which
circumstance? Since the origins of the Left in the 18th and 19th
centuries -- itself a product of the Age of Enlightenment --
revolutionary politics was supposed to be a means to lead humanity out
of its self-imposed social domination, i.e., capitalism. Here, political
activity entails propagating and agitating the masses through various
organizational channels: parties, trade unions, radical popular
assemblies, etc. Education was meant to be an active participatory
socially transformative process.

By contrast, during the 20th
century the Left as a political force increasingly lost its popular
strength, to the point of its ultimate death -- as Platypus points out
today. Our historical moment faces the daunting question: Are we any
more free as a society than our forebears over 200 years ago? Much time
has passed and energy expended, but have we led ourselves
anywhere?

The purpose of this panel is to reflect on this
historical narrative in relation to the raison d'être of Platypus, which
claims to be an educational project in a pre-political moment. How can
the Left engage in self-education and self-critique when it has been
hollowed out to the degree where it has little to no command over the
course of world historical events? Can we still practice strategies such
as propaganda and agitation, or does our moment require totally
different methods? Can education be considered a political act when
progressive politics today is at an impasse? What is Platypus's role in
such a task, and how does it relate to other groups and individuals who
are also seeking to rekindle a leftist movement? These questions, among
others, will inform the discussion points for the panelists' opening remarks and audience Q & A session.
