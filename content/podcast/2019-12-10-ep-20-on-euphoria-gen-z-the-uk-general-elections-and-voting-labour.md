On this episode of SPS, we discuss HBO's Euphoria, what
it says about the emerging "Zoomer" culture, and whether Gen Z's
cynicism should be taken for granted. Sophia Freeman interviews Peter
Tatchell, a human rights advocate and veteran activist of the LGBTQ
movement. They discuss his experience on the left and his thoughts on
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party. On the second half of the episode, Pamela
Nogales is joined by London Platypus members, Efraim C., Rory H.,
Dominic J. and fellow traveler, Rebekah P., at the London School of
Economics. They discuss the latest on Brexit & the upcoming
election, as well as what it means to vote Labour today.
