On this episode, Sophia Freeman and Pamela C. are joined\
by Allison Hewitt-Ward, a New York Platypus member and art critic. They\
discuss the recent crack-up at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and\
the relationship between art and political protest. In the second\
segment, Sophia and Pam interview Goldsmiths University's graduating\
Masters art students, Alexander Pierce, Lydia Blakeley, Fred Bungay,\
Paula Pinho Martins Nacif and Sara Rodrigues, about the relationship\
between art and freedom and if the censorship of art is ever justified.

Feedback, criticism, and questions are always welcome. Drop us an e-mail at <shitplatypussays@gmail.com>.
