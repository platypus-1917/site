The Platypus Affiliated Society, established in December 2006, organizes reading groups, public fora, research and [journalism](/platypus-review) focused on problems and tasks inherited from the "Old" (1920s-30s), "New" (1960s-70s) and post-political (1980s-90s) Left for the possibilities of emancipatory politics today.
