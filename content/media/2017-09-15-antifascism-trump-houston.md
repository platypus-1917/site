title: Antifascism in the Age of Trump
subtitle: A Panel Discussion
excerpt: Since the Nazi seizure of power eighty years ago anti-fascism has been a component of left-wing politics. In response to the Trump presidency, the politics of anti-fascism, reminiscent of the Popular Front of the 30's or the Black Bloc politics of the 90s, have -- once again -- been resurrected by the Left. How is anti-fascism the same or different today? Why anti-fascism now?
