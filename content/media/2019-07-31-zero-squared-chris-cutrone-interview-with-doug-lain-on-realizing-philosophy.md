Douglas Lain of Zero Squared podcast for Zero Books interviews Chris Cutrone on Realizing Philosophy.

Chris\
Cutrone is a college educator, writer, and media artist, committed to\
critical thinking and artistic practice and the politics of social\
emancipation. He is the former head of the often contrarian Marxist\
group The Platypus Affiliated Society and in this podcast, we discuss\
the possibility of realizing philosophy.
