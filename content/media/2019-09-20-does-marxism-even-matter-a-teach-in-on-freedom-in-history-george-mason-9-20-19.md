*An introductory workshop by member Ethan Linehan on the development of freedom in human history from the Platypus perspective.*

In the mid-19th century, Marx and Engels famously observed that a \"spectre was haunting Europe: the spectre of Communism\". 170 years later, it is Marxism itself that haunts us, while capitalism remains.

What does it mean that Marx and Marxism still appeal, while political movements for socialism are weak or non-existent? What were Marxism\'s original points concerning radical possibilities for freedom that might still speak to the present?

Does Marxism even matter?
