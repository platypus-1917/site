What
do we mean by a liberated sexuality? What are the bounds of sexual
freedom available to us in capitalism? How do we imagine sexual
liberation in socialism? Leftists have variously articulated phenomena
such as same-sex marriage, sex work, abortion, gender fluidity and
homosexuality as symptoms of economic austerity and/or of class
privilege. How does economic life shape our imaginations of sexual
freedom?

Why has the state historically intervened in private
sexual life under capitalism, and under what circumstances, if any,
should the Left support calls for state intervention in sexual life?
Both historically and in the present, the Left has sought to lead the
struggle for sexual rights within capitalism-- for same-sex marriage,
abortion rights, the decriminalization of homosexuality and of sex work,
etc.-- in society and/or by legislating via state power. How has the
Left failed or succeeded to relate its civil-social and political
efforts in the struggle for sexual liberation?
