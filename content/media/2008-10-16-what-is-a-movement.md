>The desire for revolution cannot be born only when the situation is ripe, because among the conditions for this ripeness are the revolutionary demands made of an unripe reality.

---Leszek Kolakowski

>But it is absurd to think of a purely 'objective' foresight. The person who has foresight in reality has a 'programme' that he wants to see triumph, and foresight is precisely an element of this triumph.

---Antonio Gramsci

>The socialist order of society is not prevented by world history; it is historically possible. But it will not be realized by a logic that is immanent to history but by men trained in theory and determined to make things better. Otherwise, it will not be realized at all.

---Max Horkheimer

>...every shortcoming in historical duty increases the necessary disorder and prepares more serious catastrophes.

---Antonio Gramsci
