"In the mid-19th century, Marx and Engels observed in the Communist Manifesto that a "specter" was haunting Europe: the specter of Communism. A century and a half later, it is Marxism itself that continues to haunt the Left, while capitalism remains.

What does it mean that Marx and Marxism still hold appeal, while political movements for socialism are weak or non-existent? What were Marxism's original points of departure for considering radical possibilities for freedom that might still speak to the present?

Does Marxism still matter?"

This teach-in will be led by Lou Sterrett
