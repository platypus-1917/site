The single-payer insurance model is the basis of the health care systems of other advanced industrial nations such as the United Kingdom and Canada, so what accounts for the apparent impracticality of achieving this reform in the United States? If the single-payer system is so much more rational and humane than the alternatives, why does it play such a marginal role in American politics? And if one is seriously committed to this reform, how might the situation change? Joining us on _Radical Minds_ to discuss these questions and more is [Helen Redmond](/speakers/helen-redmond/), a medical social worker, independent journalist and a member of the Chicago Single Payer Action Network and the International Socialist Organization.
