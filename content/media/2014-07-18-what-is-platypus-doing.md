## Questions

What have been some of the more significant engagements in your chapter with the Left? Why was this important for the development of your chapter and, what has this engagement taught us about the nature international Left?

What are some challenges in building your local chapter, what is the landscape of the Left that makes it hard to navigate, etc?

Why Platypus? Why does platypus need to exist in your location aside from you being there?What are the recurring points of discussions within your chapter? Do you feel like your chapter differs from the international discussions if so how?

This is an international conference, in what way do you see yourself as part of an international organization and how do you see Platypus as an international project? What do you see as the growing trends in the Left in the next year or two? How might Platypus be positioned to address these? Should it?

Where do you want Platypus to go? What other kind of engagements do you hope to foster in the future with the help of other international chapters?
