## Description

Austerity measures stemming from the global financial crisis threaten to undermine public sector unions and the services they provide. The unions, however, have failed to politicize the crisis along class lines, and by extension, to the Left. This is leading to situations like the Toronto mayoral election where union activity was stigmatized opportunistically to motivate a rightward populism.

If anything, this crisis reveals that the connection between public sector unionism and the Left has become unclear. This is a problem that cannot be solved by simply reconsidering union strategy pragmatically; its solution depends on working through and clarifying the history, ideology and politics that underlie how public sector unions and the Left have come to relate.

This teach-in with leading Canadian labour analyst [Sam Gindin](/speakers/sam-gindin) explores the present crisis, its meaning and how we might get beyond it. His recent piece with Michael Hurley, titled "The Public Sector: Search for a Focus" considers how union activity could be changed not only to meet the challenge of austerity but also to reignite the Canadian Left.
