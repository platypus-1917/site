## Description

The reelection of Obama presented a problem for the American left. Lost was the hopeful rhetoric of transforming society for the better, and as it became clear that Obama's administration had returned to "politics-as-usual," the left began to cynically appraise the purported gains made in his first term. Not the least of these was the claim that we live in a "post-racial" society. From Abolitionism to the Civil Rights Movement, the issue of racism was and is a defining one for the American left. As social life in the United States has reproduced itself through various social and ideological transformations, racism seemed always to reproduce itself in and through those transformations. And, surely not without merit is the contemporary left's skepticism regarding America's supposed achievement of a "post-racial society." Yet, any talk of race in the current age must account for the fact that America's first black president was twice elected by substantial margins. If anti-Black racism subsists, it clearly does not have the same relationship it once did to capitalism and society in general. This panel will investigate the how the left understands the concept of race in contemporary politics, and how this concept can, should, or will maintain of political significance for a future renascent left.
