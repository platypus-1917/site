The Platypus Affiliated Society is proud to host James Vaughn, PhD., for his talk on the United Kingdom's forthcoming withdrawal from the European Union in three historical contexts: 1. the development of capitalism and Great Power rivalry from the nineteenth century to the present; 2. the evolution of the liberal world order and European integration since the Second World War; and 3. the rise, triumph, and crisis of neoliberalism from the 1970s to today. There will be plenty of time for discussion afterwards. Light refreshments will be served!
