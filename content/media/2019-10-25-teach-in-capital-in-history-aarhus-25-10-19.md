*Teach-in at Aarhus by Platypus member Victor Cova.*

**Description:**\
The contemporary left seems weaker than ever. Compared to the uprisings of the 1960s, to say nothing of the world revolution of the 1920s, the events that followed the 2008 crisis ([\#Occupy](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/occupy), Arab revolutions, Movement of the Squares, Black Lives Matter\...) were nothing short of disappointing. Marxism had inspired many of these earlier revolutionary attempts, but now seems hopelessly obscure. Where left-wing movements continue to talk about \"capitalism\", \"class\", and \"revolution\", it is rarely clear what they mean by these words.

What is capitalism? What is capital? Why did Marx write a critique of political economy? How did this contribute to a world revolutionary movement? What has the failure of this world revolution meant for the Left? Is Marxism about revealing relations of domination that are concealed by ideology?
