_Platypus Affiliated Society member [Chris Cutrone](/speakers/chris-cutrone) on RT's Crosstalk, hosted by Peter Lavelle, on the global economic crisis._

{{< youtube GRkxRQC9K4 >}}

"The IMF has released a report that predicts the hoped-for global economic growth is again endangered. Why is this happening? Why has the Great Recession come back so early? Did it ever end? Has austerity made things worse? And is there a way to avoid the 'fiscal cliff' issue in Washington? CrossTalking with Seijiro Takeshita (Mizuho International, London), Martin Hennecke (Tyche Group, Hong Kong) and [Chris Cutrone](/speakers/chris-cutrone) (School of the Art Institute of Chicago)." The impasse of policy, stimulus vs. austerity, and the question of different models for capitalism and the need for socialism.
