> However difficult the task of grasping and confronting global capital might be, it is crucially important that a global internationalism be recovered and reformulated...

> The Left should be very careful about constituting a form of politics that, from the standpoint of human emancipation, would be questionable, at the very best, however many people it may rouse.

---Moishe Postone, "History and Helplessness" (2006)

_A moderated panel discussion and audience Q & A on issues of global capital, imperialism and war, possibilities for progressive political opposition, and the problems and tasks for the Left in the post-Cold War and post-9/11 world raised by the invasions and occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq. Held on January 30, 2007, in Chicago._
