Panel discussion on the life and legacy of Karl Marx as a revolutionary intellectual, hosted by the Platypus Affiliated Society on March 27, 2019 at the University of Tennessee (Knoxville).

Speakers:
**Dr. Harry Dahms**, *University of Tennessee* (Sociology)
**Dr. Arnold Farr**, *University of Kentucky* (Philosophy)
**Dr. Spencer Leonard**, *Platypus Affiliated Society*

Moderated by AJ Knowles.

Description: This past year marked the 200^th^ birthday of Karl Marx, than whom, as even his ideological opponent Isaiah Berlin had to admit, "no thinker in the nineteenth century has had so direct, deliberate and powerful an influence upon mankind." This panel seeks to bring together intellectuals committed to exploring Marx's legacy in this post-Marxist age, those who, once more, seek somehow to bring that legacy to bear upon the world. Accordingly, we want to raise the question: *What is the legacy of Marx's life as a revolutionary intellectual* \-- that is, *the legacy of the political writings and activities he contributed to the socialist workers' movement?*
