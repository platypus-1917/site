_Sammy Medina, Pam C. Nogales C., and Ross Wolfe gave teach-ins as part of the Free University during the Day of Action against Cooper Union's unprecedented tuition requirements. Pam did a teach-in on 19-century American history and struggles for emancipation, while Sammy and Ross talked about the sociohistoric project of early modernist architecture._

Both teach-ins are available on our [media site](http://media.platypus1917.org/platypus-at-free-cooper-union/)!
