## Description

The "death of art" has been a recurring theme within aesthetic and philosophical discourse for over two centuries. At times, this "death" has been proclaimed as an accomplished fact; at others, artists themselves have taken the "death of art" as a goal to be accomplished. We are asking contemporary academics, activists and most importantly practicing artists to address this concept and answer the question, "If avant-garde movements once declared uncompromising war on art in order to tear down the barrier between art and life, would the end or overcoming of art not similarly require that the world itself become artistic?"
