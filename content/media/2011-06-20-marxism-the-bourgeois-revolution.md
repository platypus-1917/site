## Description

The "bourgeois revolutions" from the 16th through the 19th centuries -- extending into the 20th -- conformed humanity to modern city life, ending traditional, pastoral, religious custom in favor of social relations of the exchange of labor. Abbé Sieyès wrote in 1789 that, in contradistinction to the clerical 1st Estate who "prayed" and the aristocratic 2 Estate who "fought," the commoner 3 Estate "worked:" "What has the 3 Estate been? Nothing." "What is it? Everything." Kant warned that universal bourgeois society would be the mere midpoint in humanity's achievement of freedom. After the last bourgeois revolutions in Europe of 1848 failed, Marx wrote of the "constitution of capital," the ambivalent, indeed self-contradictory character of "free wage labor." In the late 20th century, the majority of humanity abandoned agriculture in favor of urban life -- however in "slum cities." How does the bourgeois revolution appear from a Marxian point of view? How did what Marx called the "proletarianization" of society circa 1848 signal not only the crisis and supersession, but the need to fulfill and "complete" the bourgeois revolution, whose task now fell to the politics of "proletarian" socialism, expressed by the workers' call for "social democracy?" How did this express the attempt, as Lenin put it, to overcome bourgeois society "on the basis of capitalism" itself? How did subsequent Marxism lose sight of Marx on this, and how might Marx's perspective on the crisis of the bourgeois revolution in the 19th century still resonate today?
