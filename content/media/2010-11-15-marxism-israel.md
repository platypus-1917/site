_A roundtable discussion between [Alan Goodman](/speakers/alan-goodman) from The Revolutionary Communist Party USA, and [Richard Rubin](/speakers/richard-rubin) from Platypus entitled "Marxism and Israel: Left Perspectives on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict" at Hunter College in New York City. Panelists were asked to speak on the role the Left has played in the development of Israel, the Left's analysis of the role of American intervention in the Middle East, and what a critical Marxian approach to the conflict currently looks like, compared to what it might look like._

Transcript in [Platypus Review #35](/2011/05/05/marxism-and-israel-left-perspectives-on-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/)

## Description

Questions for the panelists:

1. Historically, what role has the Marxist Left played in the development of Israel? What would a critical Marxist perspective on Israel, the ideology of Zionism and the Palestinian conflict look like? Has a Left critique historically been applied?

2. What is the relationship between American political hegemony and Israel? How has this traditionally been understood by the "Left", and how is it now portrayed? Has this understanding obscured attempts at political and theoretical analysis? How has it affected the international "Left's" approach to the actual political opposition among Palestinians?

3. Why have leftist approaches to the conflict emphasized a politics of resistance over cogent political visions? Do measures, such as BDS campaigns and the Flotilla effort, that seek to delegitimize Israel and the ideology of Zionism through resistance to its immediate means and policies ameliorate immediate social conditions or clarify political conditions? If not, what sort of approach should be emphasized?
