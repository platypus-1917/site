## Description

Alain Badiou's recent book (2010) is titled with the phrase promoted by his and Slavoj Žižek's work for the last few years, "the communist hypothesis." Žižek has spoken of "the Badiou event" as opening new horizons for both philosophy and communism. Badiou and Žižek share a background in Lacanian and Althusserian "post-structuralist" French thought, in common with other prominent post-New Left thinkers "and former students of Louis Althusser" such as Etienne Balibar and Jacques Ranciére. Althusser found, in the Russian and Chinese Revolutions, a salutary challenge to the notion of the Hegelian "logic of history," that revolutionary change could and indeed did happen as a matter of contingency. For Badiou, this means that emancipation must be conceived of as an "event," which involves a fundamental reconsideration of ontology.
