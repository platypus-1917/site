[Sammy Medina](/speakers/sammy-medina/), [Pam C. Nogales C.](/speakers/pam-c-nogales-c), and [Ross Wolfe](/speakers/ross-wolfe) gave teach-ins as part of the Free University during the Day of Action against Cooper Union's unprecedented tuition requirements. Pam did a teach-in on 19-century American history and struggles for emancipation, while Sammy and Ross talked about the sociohistoric project of early modernist architecture.
