title: Is Marx Back?
subtitle: An Interview with Leo Panitch
---

The economic crisis, as many commentators and critics are quick to point out, has rekindled interest in -- and anxieties over -- Marxism. Although many on the Left hope this renewed curiosity marks the beginning of a radical turn, similar revivals of anti-capitalist politics in the 1930s, 1960s, and 1990s failed to achieve the revolutionary transformations they sought.

Has Marxism returned as a significant political force? How might this translate into the possibility for a revitalized Left? Will the resurgence of Marxist theory provide opportunities for social change -- or merely the opportunity to fail again?

An interview with Dr. [Leo Panitch](/speakers/leo-panitch) conducted on February 19, 2010, at the University of Toronto.

Dr. [Leo Panitch](/speakers/leo-panitch) is Canada Research Chair in Comparative Political Economy and Distinguished Research Professor of Political Science at York University in Toronto, and coeditor of the annual Socialist Register.

A transcript ranscript of this interview was published in [Platypus Review #23](/2010/05/09/is-marx-back-an-interview-with-leo-panitch-pr/)
