## Description

It seems that there are still only two radical ideologies: Anarchism and Marxism. They emerged out of the same crucible
 - the Industrial Revolution, unsuccessful revolutions in 1848 and 1871, a weak liberalism, the centralization of state power, the rise of the workers movement, and the promise of socialism. They are the revolutionary heritage. All significant radical upsurges of the last 150 years have returned to mine their meaning for the current situation. Our moment seems no different.

There are a few different ways these have been taken up. Recent worldwide square occupations reflect one pattern: some version of Marxist theory - understood as a political economic critique of capitalism
 - is used to comprehend the world, while an anarchist practice
 - understood as an anti-hierarchical principle that insists revolution must begin now
 - is used to organize, in order to change it. Another option: some resist this combination, claiming that Marxism repudiates anti-statist adventurism, and calls for a strategic reorganization of the working class to resist austerity, and perhaps push forward a "New New Deal". This view remains wedded to a purportedly practical welfarist social democracy, which strengthens the state and manages capital. There is a good deal of hand-waving in both these

orientations
 - as to the base of politics, as to tactics and strategy, as to the end goal. Finally, there are attempts to leave the grounds of these theories entirely
 - but these often seem either to land right back in one of the camps or to remain marginal.

To act today we seek to draw up the balance sheet of the 20th century. The historical experience concentrated in these ideas must be unfurled if they are to serve as

compass points. In what ways the return of these ideologies represent an authentic engagement
 - and in what ways the return of a ghost? Where have the battles left us? What forms do we have for meeting - theoretically and practically
 - the problems of the day?

### Questions

What do Marxism and Anarchism have to say to those politicized today? Do they instruct us as to how we might act, now? Must we return to these orientations? If so, how?

Many recent leftist groupings tend toward square occupation and leaderless horizontality, while retaining an unclear, even reformist, ideological orientation toward capitalism and the state. How do you understand the advent of these forms? Do they challenge traditional Marxist theory and ways of organizing? Are they affirmations of Anarchist modes of thinking and practice? In general, what forms of organization are necessitated by the theories we inherit and the tasks of today?

Can you briefly assess the most important splits and breaks between and within both traditions? Does the historical divide between Marxism and Anarchism still matter? What are the significant splits within Marxism and within Anarchism that continue to shape the context?

What are the inalienable values and the end goals of radical politics? Are Marxism and Anarchism ideologies of freedom? Of democracy? Of the working class? How do they handle the objective contradictions of realizing these principles under the conditions of capitalist life?

What should we fight for today
 - more state or less state? Has history vindicated Marxism or Anarchism or neither at all?
