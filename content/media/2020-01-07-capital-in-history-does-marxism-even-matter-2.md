This teach-in will be led by Matthew Ramirez.

In the mid-19th century, Marx and Engels observed, in the Communist\
Manifesto, that a \"specter\" was haunting Europe Ã¢ the specter of\
Communism. A century and a half later, it is Marxism itself that\
continues to haunt the Left, while capitalism remains.

What does it mean that Marx and Marxism still appeal, while political\
movements for socialism are weak or non- existent? What were Marxism\'s\
original points of departure for considering radical possibilities for\
freedom that might still speak to the present?

How does Marxism still matter?
